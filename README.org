* BACnet-logger

  An application used to scan a BACnet network at regulvar interval
  and send the data back to a webserver.

  Similar to [[https://github.com/Frozenlock/Bacnet-scan][Bacnet-scan]]. Requires BACnet/IP to work.

* How to use

  Create a =config.cjm= file, with the following content (as needed):
:  {:logger-password "my-password", 
: :project-id "afh352vds44ae4e7182a471b6"
: :broadcast-address "192.168.0.255"
: :port 47808}

  Then run the compiled jar. Default implementation scans the network
  very 10 min.
